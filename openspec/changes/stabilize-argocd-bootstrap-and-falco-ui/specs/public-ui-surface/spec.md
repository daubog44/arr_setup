## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Falco and Litmus are first-class official UIs when enabled

The operator-visible UI catalog MUST include Falco and Litmus when those UIs are intentionally published.

#### Scenario: Falco is enabled

- **WHEN** Falco is enabled in operator inputs
- **THEN** the official route catalog MUST publish the Falcosidekick Web UI through the shared ingress pattern
- **AND** Homepage MUST include the Falco UI link
- **AND** the backing Falco Application MUST converge on this LXC-based cluster instead of remaining degraded behind an auth redirect
